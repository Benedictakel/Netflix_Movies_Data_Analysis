## 📝 Introduction

This project explores **COVID-19 data** to:

✅ Analyze confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally

✅ Visualize trends over time for selected countries and continents

✅ Provide insights through **line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps**

✅ Practice data analysis and visualization skills with real-world data



## 📚 Dataset

* **Source:** [Kaggle COVID-19 datasets]()
* **Data Includes:** Daily records of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and region
* **Format:** CSV files with time-series data



## ✨ Features

✔️ Load and preprocess COVID-19 global dataset

✔️ Clean and transform data for analysis

✔️ Visualize:

* Total confirmed cases per country
* Total deaths and recovery rates
* Time series plots for specific countries
* Comparative bar charts for top affected countries
* Heatmaps for global case distribution

✔️ Generate insights from trends and plots



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* *(Optional)* **Plotly** for interactive visualizations
* **Jupyter Notebook**



## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID-19_Data_Visualization.git
cd COVID-19_Data_Visualization
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```



## ▶️ Usage

1. Open the notebook file `COVID-19_Data_Visualization.ipynb`.
2. Run cells sequentially to:

* Load and preprocess the dataset
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualize global and country-specific trends
* Generate insights from results
